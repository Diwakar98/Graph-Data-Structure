# Graph-Data-Structure
This project is an implementation of graph data structure.
Make sure you have read the "Project_Description.pdf" to know all about the project.

I have used Adjacency List to make the Graph.
I have used Breadth-First-Search(BFS) to calculate the Diameter.
Sample Input and Output files are given for reference.
